This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: using raw pointers with mutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains code that modifies a vector through a raw pointer, leading to data corruption or crashes. The solution, in `bugSolution.rs`, leverages safe Rust techniques to achieve the intended outcome without risking memory unsafety.
